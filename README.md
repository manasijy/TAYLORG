This repository is general purpose. It has texture evolution scritp written by me.
It also has script to calculate divergence about a given rotation i.e., to determine if an orientation is stable under the imposed deformation.
It also has VPSC files to calulate the texture evolutions.
This one has Meff codes, divergence codes, lp codes and many more. Very useful.
